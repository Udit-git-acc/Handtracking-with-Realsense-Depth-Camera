# Handtracking-with-Realsense-Depth-Camera
Due to the unavailability of the Intel Realsense depth camera
we donâ€™t have the output of the camera which is an RGBD
output so we are using only the laptop webcam as a temporary
replacement for the depth camera which has RGB output. The
code done so far is in accordance with the webcam, hence the
brush thickness is constant which can be later made varied
once will have the output of Realsense Depth camera. The
rest of the code will remain almost the same for just we need
to switch how the image per frame is fed into the codeblock
